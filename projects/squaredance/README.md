## Description (TL;DR)
A privacy-conscious, legally compliant DAO framework for startups in Germany (and beyond), enabling fully anonymous contributors to receive equity-like economic interests using web3-native legal wrappers, while maintaining compliance with local security, tax, and IP laws.

## Problem
Setting up a legally compliant DAO is extremely difficult‚Äîso is founding any startup in Germany, in general. Regulatory complexity, liability risks, IPR assignment requirements (e.g., wet-ink signatures), and privacy concerns all make it hard for innovators‚Äîespecially those without exclusive privilege‚Äîto participate.

## Solution
We are building a web3-native framework that enables:
- instant legal setup of fully compliant organisations
- digital equity management with state-of-the-art digital contracts
- legally binding founder, contributor, and investor contracts
- fully anonymous participation with limited liability
- full pre- and post-incorporation compliance with German law

We integrate privacy-preserving technologies (ZKPs, verifiable credentials, relayers, IPFS) with traditional legal concepts to allow a new class of ‚Äúcontributor-LPs‚Äù to join an organisation and get rewarded‚Äîwithout needing to reveal their identities.

## Technology Stack
- Smart Contracts: EVM Solidity
- Document Signing & Storage: IPFS, off-chain legal wrappers

## Privacy Impact
Our framework should empower individuals to:

- Prove eligibility (age, uniqueness, non-membership) without doxxing themselves
- Sign legal agreements anonymously (e.g., contributor contracts with IP assignment)
- Maintain sovereignty over participating in regulated bureacracy, while remaining compliant

By replacing traditional KYC with ZK attestations and verifiable credentials, contributors can engage with DAOs pseudonymously‚Äîwithout compromising legal integrity. Organisations can choose to incorporate and abide by the corresponding rules in the given jurisdiction or stay flexible and private.

## Real-World Use Cases
Real-World Use Cases
- Early-stage startups seeking legally compliant formation way
- Organisations wishing to distribute equity incentives both before and after incorporation
- Anonymous contributors who want to legally engage, sign IP assignments, and earn equity
- Professional legal-service providers

## Business Logic
Monetization can stem from:
- Minor transaction fees on all contracts (significantly under the current legal fees)
- Operating the protocol as a SaaS with custodian implementation and web3 abstraction

## What's Next
- Finish the initial version of the smart contracts üòÖ
- Develop a UI for generating and signing contributor contracts anonymously
- Legal Logic: German GbR to GmbH succession
- Integrate ZK identity providers: idOS, Semaphore, Sismo, ZKPath, Worldcoin (if proves to be privacy-preserving))
